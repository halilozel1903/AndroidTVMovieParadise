Android TV is a version of the Android operating system. It's developed by Google for soundbars, set-top boxes, digital media players, and TVs with native applications. It's a replacement for Google TV. Android TV platform was first launched in June 2014. This platform has also been adopted as smart TV middleware by a company such as Sharp and Sony.

**Project Objective**: This app is designed to provide users with a seamless movie discovery and streaming experience on the big screen.

Movie Paradise is an Android TV üì∫ app. This app is working Android TV & Android STB. üìπ üéû

The application uses **The Movie Database** API to fetch movie data: üëáüèª

The application uses the basic components of Android TV application.

Build apps that let users experience your app's immersive content on the big screen. Users can discover your content recommendations on the home screen, and the leanback library provides APIs to help you build a great use experience for a remote control.

I wrote a blog post about Android TV. You can access the article from the link below.

## How to Build the App
Using standard Android TV components and libraries, follow these steps to build the app locally:

1.  Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url/AndroidTVMovieParadise.git
```
2.  Open the project in Android Studio.
3.  Sync Gradle files.
4.  Get an API key from [The Movie Database] (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). 
5.  Add the API key to the project.
6.  Build and run the app on an Android TV device.

## Warnings
**SAFETY WARNING: No Built-In Parental Controls**

Note, this app does not have built-in parental control features. This can be a concern for families, as younger viewers may be able to access content that is rated for mature or other audiences.

**Lack of Streaming Capabilities**

Note, this app currently does not support in-app streaming directly. Rather, this app is meant to provide movie information and facilitate a better movie-picking experience. Please use another streaming service in order to watch your desired movies.

**Wi-Fi Connection Necessary**

Note, The Movie Database API requires an active internet connection to properly function. Users without a proper Wi-Fi connection are subject to frequent interruptions and limited functionality.
